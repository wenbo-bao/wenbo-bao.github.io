# 关于我

I am student NYU majoring CS & Math and aspiring software engineer. The past summer I have interned with GrammaTech working on development of their product [CodeSonar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeSonar). I am proficient with full stack development(Python, TypeScript) and agaile DevOps. My interest lies in algorithms and I really enjoy doing LeetCode.

Besides these, I had been a math tutor at NYU Courant for the last two years. And I have worked at a residential assistant at Weinstein in summer 22.
    
Outside the realm of academics and work, I am a huge car enthusiast and I love driving stick shift. I also play basketball and watch the NBA. Last but not least, I love reading books when I am free. You can checkout what books I am currently reading [here](/readings/).

I am against social media because I don't like the recommendation and feeds. So I am hoping to use this website to tell my stories.
